# Discord Capture

> Capture messages from Discord channels into Open Brain — the same pattern as Slack capture, but for Discord.

## What It Does

A Discord bot that monitors designated channels and captures messages into Open Brain as thoughts. Messages are embedded and stored with Discord-specific metadata (server, channel, author, timestamp). Works just like the built-in Slack capture but for Discord communities.

## Prerequisites

- Working Open Brain setup ([guide](../../docs/01-getting-started.md))
- A Discord account with permission to add bots to your server
- Discord Developer Portal access (free)
- Docker Compose stack running
- LiteLLM API key (for generating embeddings)

## Credential Tracker

DISCORD CAPTURE -- CREDENTIAL TRACKER
--------------------------------------

FROM YOUR OPEN BRAIN SETUP
  LiteLLM API key:    ____________

DISCORD INFO
  Server name:           ____________

GENERATED DURING SETUP
  Discord Bot Token:     ____________
  Channel IDs to monitor:
    - ____________
    - ____________
    - ____________

--------------------------------------
```

## Steps

<!-- TODO: Fill in step-by-step instructions -->

1. Create a Discord application in the Developer Portal
2. Create a bot and copy the bot token
3. Invite the bot to your server with message read permissions
4. Configure the bot in the Node.js MCP server (`deploy/app/`)
5. Configure environment variables (bot token, channel IDs to monitor, DATABASE_URL, LiteLLM key)
6. Restart the Docker stack: `docker compose up -d`
7. Send a test message in a monitored channel
8. Verify the thought was captured in your database

## Expected Outcome

When you send a message in a monitored Discord channel, it appears as a new thought in your `thoughts` table within a few seconds. The `metadata` jsonb field includes:
- `source`: `"discord"`
- `server`: Discord server name
- `channel`: channel name
- `author`: message author's Discord username
- `timestamp`: original message timestamp

You can search for anything you've captured from Discord using your Open Brain MCP server's `search_thoughts` tool.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Bot is online but not capturing messages**
Solution: Check that the bot has "Message Content Intent" enabled in the Developer Portal (Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents). Also verify the channel IDs in your config match the channels you're posting in.

**Issue: Bot captures messages but they don't appear in the database**
Solution: Check your server logs (`docker compose logs app`). Most likely a missing or incorrect `DATABASE_URL`.

**Issue: Duplicate thoughts from edited messages**
Solution: By default, message edits create a new thought. To update the existing thought instead, set `UPDATE_ON_EDIT=true` in your environment variables.
